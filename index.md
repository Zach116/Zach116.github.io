## About
---
<p id="main-content">
I am a results-oriented Computer Science major who is currently attending Oregon State University with nearly 2 and a half
years of work experience. I'm aiming to leverage a proven knowledge of project design, programming, and
troubleshooting skills to pursue a career in Offensive Security. I've been frequently praised as
adaptable by my peers and I have a demonstrated history of interpersonal skills through my work in the IT department at Oregon State. Languages and tools I have learned include the following: C++, C, Assembly Language, Python, GDB, IDA, Java, and Javascript.</p>

## Projects

### Augmented Reality Sandbox
<ul id="main-content">
  <li>Implemented new features into an augmented reality sandbox for my senior project.</li>
  <li>The system is intended to help teach students of the Civil & Construction Engineering department at Oregon State University.</li>
  <li>Captures the terrain of the sandbox and projects a heightmap upon it.</li>
  <li>Added the ability to save terrain as a heightmap and later load it again.</li>
  <li>The loading feature works by showing how the sand needs to be altered to create the desired terrain. It does this through coloring (red is too high, blue is too low).</li>
  <li>The final goal of this project is to use real world game pieces to represent different objects. These game pieces will have some kind of user defined effect when placed upon the sandbox. A simple example is placing two wooden blocks and calculating the distance between them. This can be used to simulate different real world scenarios for educational purposes.</li>
  <li>The code repository for this project can be found on my GitHub.</li>
</ul>
